My girlfriend and I have both recently gotten into solving [Nonograms](https://www.nonograms.org/). At the same time I had started exploring Unity and game development in Unity. And the confluence of these events made me wonder how I could generate these Nonograms levels from a user-submitted image.

To that end, I started building a little prototype in Unity with Step 1 being able to load an image.

<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/BadgerBadgerBadgerBadger/BadgerBadgerBadgerBadger.github.io/assets/5138570/f3313591-39b9-4ed6-a629-16cbecfdf709"><img width="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/BadgerBadgerBadgerBadger/BadgerBadgerBadgerBadger.github.io/assets/5138570/52441939-3fa4-4052-b627-14dcce76685b">

Next I needed a way to pixelize the image. For this I took some help from ChatGPT and was informed I could try various filters. It gave me the follwing list (the item names and text are as provided by ChatGPT):

* **Nearest Neighbor**: The simplest and most straightforward algorithm. Each pixel of the resulting image is the color of the nearest pixel in the original image, creating a blocky and pixelated effect. This algorithm is fast but can result in jagged edges and loss of detail.

* **Box Filter**: This algorithm averages the color values of a block of pixels in the original image and assigns that average color to all the pixels in the corresponding block of the resulting image. It creates a smoother pixelation effect compared to nearest neighbor, reducing the jagged edges.

* **Scale2x**: Scale2x is a scale-up algorithm that doubles the size of each pixel by replicating the original pixel's color in a 2x2 block. It smooths out the pixelation effect and creates a cleaner look.

* **Pixel Art Shader**: Pixel art shaders simulate the appearance of pixel art by introducing dithering, color palette restrictions, and limited shading. These shaders can be customized to achieve various pixelation styles and effects.

* **Ordered Dithering**: Ordered dithering uses a predefined matrix pattern to selectively adjust the pixel values, simulating additional colors and shades within the limited color palette. It creates the illusion of smoother gradients and a wider range of colors in pixel art.

* **Error Diffusion**: Error diffusion algorithms, such as Floyd-Steinberg or Jarvis-Judice-Ninke, distribute the quantization errors caused by reducing the color palette to neighboring pixels. This diffusion helps maintain the overall visual quality while achieving a pixelated appearance.

This is a lot of things I don't quite understand. By reading these names and descriptions alone I could not figure out how many of them would lead to a pixelation effect. How would nearest neighbor work if I'm converting a 512x512 image into a 10x10 image? What's the nearest neighbor of pixel 3,2 of the 10x10 image in the 512x512 image? And how would scaling in the Scale2x technique help? Pixel Art Shader seems like an area to explore more but it sounds like the name for a class of algorithms or techniques than a single one and Ordered Dithering and Error Diffusion are both things that go over my head.

The only thing that made sense immediately was the Box Filter. Define a box for a block of pixels and the colour of that box would be the average colour of those pixels. That makes immediate sense. So I decided to try that out first.

For the purpose of experimentation I chose 4 images:

I built a pixelation function based on the Box Filter algorithm and got these results:

I...don't like this. While the banana and duck look somewhat recognisable, the elephant is missing a discernible trunk and Sherk's ears are all but a blobby mess. So let's try some other options.
